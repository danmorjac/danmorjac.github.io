This is my portfolio, here you can see a bit of me and my journey

Notes:

Tools or sites that helped in the develop:

1. All design decisions and stylistic approach have been devised by me.

2. Nevertheless, in creating the portfolio I have received some help.

    - ChatGPT: This is the main source that has helped me with some simple questions about some doubts.

      But I have to honestly emphasize one aspect:

      The JS is 80% mine, but in certain things, such as the DOM manipulation methods that I did not know, such as the .foreach that the AI ​​suggested to me.

    - The cards are a mix of ideas from various sites and videos that are currently impossible to compile, they have not been made by any AI, that type of cards doesn't exist anywhere, since they have been made progressively over 4 months (I started before to deliver the 1st part)

3. The images used are all my own or from third parties who have given me explicit permission to use them.The rest of the images are generated by AI and/or modified by me.
